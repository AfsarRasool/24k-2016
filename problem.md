Objective 3: ALGORITHM
PROBLEM 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
1)	Enter a divisor 
2)	Enter a dividend
3)	If 
Dividend%divisor ==0
                else if 
                 divisor%2==0 then dividend is even
               else 
                  display odd.
